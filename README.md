# 📊 Student Habits vs Academic Performance

This project explores how various lifestyle habits impact students' academic performance using an interactive Tableau dashboard. Leveraging a simulated dataset of 1,000 student profiles, this analysis reveals key patterns between behavior and final exam scores.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Have you ever wondered how much your sleep, study time, or social media usage actually affects your grades? This project investigates those lifestyle factors by visualizing the relationship between:

- Study hours  
- Mental health ratings  
- Sleep patterns  
- Exercise frequency  
- Class attendance  
- Final exam scores  

Using Tableau, I created a story-driven dashboard to surface insights and answer questions around what drives academic success beyond just classroom attendance or hours spent studying.

## 📌 Key Findings

- 🕐 **Study Hours ≠ Perfect Scores:**  
  Despite studying for over 5 hours, only **2.5%** of students earned a **100% exam score**—indicating that study time alone doesn’t guarantee top performance.

- 🧠 **Mental Health Matters:**  
  On a scale of 1 (lowest) to 11 (highest), students with **mental health ratings above 9** consistently scored **over 90%**, emphasizing the impact of well-being on academic success.

- 😴💪 **Lifestyle Combo Effects:**  
  A combination of **poor sleep** and **low exercise frequency** was associated with **lower exam scores**, revealing the compounded effects of multiple negative habits.

- 🏫 **Attendance Isn’t Everything:**  
  Only **3 out of 1,000 students** with **perfect attendance** scored 100% on the exam, suggesting that presence alone doesn’t ensure mastery.
